<h2>Coaching &amp; Organisational Development</h2>
<p>Organisations need people to flourish, and people need organisations to function well and prosper.  It is about holding the needs of both, that is at the core of Fay’s work.  She has extensive experience in highly complex organisational environments, as well as a strong academic and training background; all of which underpins her Coaching and Organisational Development (OD) practice.</p>
<p>Fay works closely with her clients to understand their needs and co-creates learning and development interventions to make change possible. She helps individuals, teams and organisations work though change by using her skills in coaching, facilitation and organisational development.  Always working with integrity and commitment.</p>
<p>As a specialist in learning and development, Fay’s working life has been dedicated to developing and refining the skills of a coach and OD practitioner. Along with insight and creativity, she brings a sense of humanity, creating a learning environment where people can flourish.</p>
