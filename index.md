    "Coaching has been a life saver for me. In such a short space of time (possibly even after the first session)
    my confidence improved exponentially. I have found the strength within myself to take on new challenges – a
    new job in fact! I am very grateful for the opportunity to partake in coaching and Fay has made such a difference to my life."
