<p>I have recently had the privilege of watching a new team develop from its conception through its incubation into the creation of a definite sapling team. It is my 10 year old son’s football team. It has been a real joy to see the difference from the start when a group of children happened to be playing football at the same time, to now where there is a definite sense of there being a single entity.</p>

<p>But this weekend there was a blow. The team was in a tournament and they were up against a team four divisions up, with predictable results. My son’s team was getting thoroughly beaten. I found myself observing this game and asking once again what is it about the winning team that was making them succeed, and what happens when a team is failing - how do team members respond?</p>
<p>On the winning team I was reminded that it wasn’t just the individual skills that were at a different level, it was how they inter-related. Everyone appeared not only to be clear in their role but how their role related to the whole; what their contribution was. They were obviously practiced in how they interacted with each other, with set patterns used to pass between them. Most importantly of all - whoever had the ball - all of the players were checking out where they positioned themselves in relation to their team mates; this constant checking of the needs of their peers and how they related to them was obviously the responsibility of all, not just the captain.</p>
<p>And what for my son’s team that was losing? Again predictably, they reverted to a group of individuals swarming round the ball, each person lethargic and de-motivated , disconnecting with others and internalising their experience. Ultimately, each were trying to win the game through their own individual actions... and failing. Does this sound familiar to some workplace teams?</p>
<p>So what can we learn from this for the workplace? Well for me it renewed the understanding that everyone is responsible for looking after the whole, and we need to keep checking out how the whole is doing, this can’t be seen as a job simply for those higher in the structure. We need not just to know what our role is but how our role contributes to that whole. And finally it is our interconnections that we need to practice and understand. Unfortunately, so often in the workplace it is this we spend so little time developing.</p>
<p>So what can help a either a sapling or mature team grow and develop? In my opinion a team coach, just as a football coach, can help a team see the whole. He/she can provide feedback so the team can adjust when they need to, provide an environment where everyone can see and take responsibility for their own contribution and allow the team to practice whatever interactions are most useful to them.</p>
<p>And what for my son’s team? Well thankfully they had great resilience strategies and between matches messed around together and remembered that they all just loved playing football!</p>
