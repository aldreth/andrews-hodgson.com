<p>And by everyone I mean everyone; doctor, nurse, administrator, finance manager, cook, porter, OT, gardener…etc.</p>
<p>I had this thought when passing a colleague from the army who works occasionally within our department in the NHS.  Walking past his desk and I noticed his notebook/diary styled in camouflage; the uniformity of this struck me.  I pondered about the impact of the army’s single uniform on the way it functions as a team.  (NB I have since discovered from another acquaintance that there are differences within the British army, but anyway stick with me……)</p>

<p>I work with many teams, often when individuals within those teams are struggling to see eye to eye.  And frequently there is an element of tribalism involved; to which profession/role/group do you belong?  We all know as human beings we have a need to belong, and the workplace provides us various structures through which to do that.  But when does the sense of belonging to one identity start to erode the belonging to another and in doing so impact what we’re trying to achieve.  I have at times witnessed such a strong allegiance to a profession it allowed little room for any allegiance to an operational grouping (for example).</p>
<p>I can hear the cries already “If we had the same uniform how would the patients know who we were?&rdquo;</p>
<p>To which we could reply</p>
<ol>
<li>Surely a good personal introduction could overcome this?</li>
<li>Do patients really care as long as we are helping and explaining what we are doing</li>
</ol>
<p>I may be being slightly facetious, and there may well be many other valid reasons as to why it would be a bad idea… but I’m intrigued by this random thought, intrigued by the potential impact it may have on how staff interact.</p>
<p>So what if………?</p>
