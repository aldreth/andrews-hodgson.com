<p>I went to a conference recently about system thinking and somebody used the word ‘solutioneering’ to mean the thing we all do/are expected to do, to find an immediate solution to the problem, kind of solutions for the sake of it.  It has a touch of the gallant rescuer edge to it.  The problem with this is that in the NHS, and probably many other organisations, the reason things are a problem is... well it’s often really complicated, especially if there are people involved.</p>
<p><!--more-->In Organisational Development we may well be called into a situation where a team or sometimes a whole department is struggling and asked to produce a plan. A plan to put things right.  The problem with producing a large scale plan, in particular if it is a large scale team, such as a whole department is that.... well it’s complicated.</p>
<p>There are so many variables at play; people leaving, people going on sick, new people starting, staffing levels changing unexpectedly, a critical incident to have taken place, non-work related situations, power dynamics, changes in workloads/patterns, an HR process taking place, the implementation of something unpopular that has come from a national level etc, the list is endless and can include things at a micro as well as macro level.  Any of these may create considerable shift within a team and so sometimes when asked to come up with a large scale plan at one point in time to help a team it can feel like we are being asked to solutioneer.</p>
<p>So what’s the answer?  I wonder if we can take the learning from IT software development.  My husband works as a web programmer and there they follow the principle of ‘Agile development’. The Agile principle is basically that rather than coming up with a large scale plan at the beginning of a project that only gets tested by the user only at delivery stage, they start with a ‘minimum viable product’  (in our OD case, intervention)  and then seek feedback, and then developing the next part of the project.It has been found that by doing this in IT development, rather than getting to the end point and discovering what has been developed is not fit for purpose, work is delivered that is effective, well thought out and right for the end user.</p>
<p>Working in this iterative way means that not all the decisions have to be taken at the start of the process, when not all the problems or needs are fully understood. The equivalent for an OD intervention might be rather than spending considerable time developing a workshop/series of workshops to put the whole department through, to make smaller intervention steps that are then developed upon in a more interative and incremental  manner.  This way we can learn what works from the client’s perspective and we can respond to all those variables with a rapid and flexible response of ‘…and what’s needed now’.  We look to build up sustainable, organic, evolving partnerships with our sponsors, with a view to fade away.</p>
<p>To ground this approach, the Agile methodology has a manifesto it follows:</p>
<p><strong>“1. Individuals and interactions</strong> over Processes and tools<br />
<strong>2. Working software</strong> over Comprehensive documentation<br />
<strong>3. Customer collaboration</strong> over Contract negotiation<br />
<strong>4. Responding to change</strong> over Following a plan <em>That is, while there is value in the items on the right, we value the items on the left more</em><sup> “</sup></p>
<p>So how could that relate to OD.</p>
<ol>
<li>We can think ‘what’s needed here?’ over ‘what tools to we have?’ - we can make it up more!</li>
<li>We can think ‘let’s start with…’ over  ‘I’ll get back to you when I’ve drafted the workshop’</li>
<li>We can think ‘how can I keep collecting information about what’s needed here?’ over ‘I’ve got what I need now to design the intervention’</li>
<li>We can think ‘..and what’s needed now?’ over ‘before, you said you needed this…’</li>
</ol>
<p>And many of us work in this way already to a degree, but I wonder if we can explore what it would look like if we applied it more?  It’s not about not planning, just planning for iteration.  And I wonder if it can help us explain to our sponsoring colleagues how we work…. and avoid OD solutioneering.</p>
