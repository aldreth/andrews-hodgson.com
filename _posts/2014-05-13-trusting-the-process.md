<p>I have recently been learning the Alexander Technique; a technique that teaches you how to stop using unnecessary levels of muscular effort in everyday activities. Essentially it helps you to unlearn unhelpful physical habits.</p>
<p><!--more-->At various times I have been struck by the parallels between the technique and coaching. The first obvious parallel is that both the technique and coaching look often to help a client unlearn those habits that no longer serve us. In coaching we may have many ways to help our coachees explore re-programming habits, in the Alexander Technique the unlearning is simple in principle.... it’s just to say ‘Stop’. Stop to the unwanted habit, but not filling in the replacement, simply trusting the self to work it out without trying. And whatever the arena, saying ‘Stop’ can be a great place to start the re-programming of things that don’t serve us.</p>
<p>Even with the positive experiences I have had of the Alexander Technique, the other day I found myself in a part of my lesson being asked to ‘not try’, to tell myself that ‘there was nothing I needed to do’ and ‘I didn’t need to make anything change’.... Well in this moment I was struggling with the ‘Stop’....the problem was I had a really sore back and I really did want to try and make it change. However I trusted my teacher and I trusted in her knowledge and experience of the process, one still fairly unfamiliar to me. And to my surprise 15 minutes later things started to shift. And again the parallels were apparent. In coaching, ultimately we have to trust the process, and we ask our clients to trust that process also. But for those coachees who are at the beginning of their coaching journey their access to that has to be vicarious through their trust in us their coach.</p>
<p>And often it is precisely those moments when we let go of trying both as a coach and a coachee - ie trust the process - that the unexpected shifts come and that magical sense of new insight appears.</p>
