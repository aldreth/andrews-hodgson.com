<p>Coaching has been a life saver for me.  In such a short space of time (possibly even after the first session) my confidence improved exponentially.  I have found the strength within myself to take on new challenges - a new job in fact!  I am very grateful for the opportunity to partake in coaching and Fay has made such a difference to my life.</p>

<p>Working with Fay as my coaching supervisor really helped me to develop my skills, through useful exploration and also through Fay sharing her vast knowledge of coaching. Supervision was an invaluable and safe place to recharge and to also refine my practice through working creatively. Fay has a real energy and passion for what she does which amplifies the supervision experience- I can't wait to work with her again! </p>

<p>I first met Fay about 5 years ago when she was commissioned to work with my group of peers in an Organisational Development role.  Fay facilitated us in a planned and systematic way to work more effectively together in order to achieve a common ground and our desired goals. Fays ability to recognise behaviours, attitudes and encourage employees to manage themselves with a set of tools and responses made me truly believe in the power of organisational development. I was so inspired by her skills and knowledge that I asked Fay to come and provide a similar service in my department with a group of staff that had a ten year history of being a struggling team. Again I saw a positive impact where the team felt they could trust her to understand them in order to empower them to move forward in a collaborative manner.</p>

<p>As soon as I met Fay I felt able to relax and say what was important. In the supervisory relationship she creates safety and allows both seriousness and lightness to be present. The coach can use the supervision space to reflect, question and wonder-about, and in discussion with Fay insight and actions emerge. Underpinning her coaching supervision practice is her impressive theoretical understanding of different models of supervision, team issues and psychological dynamics that impact the work of a coach. This means she can work at different levels depending on the needs of the coach in the here and now. As a coach supervisor, she is experienced in the complex challenges faced by internal coaches as well as those brought by external coaches. I would definitely recommend her as a supervisor.</p>

<p>I first met Fay during my induction to York Teaching Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust. I had started in the role of operational manager having come from a clinical pharmacy background. I was experiencing a huge culture shock and I was struggling to keep my head above water in my new role. I was having a crisis of confidence and I was referred to Fay for coaching. At the time I was feeling very vulnerable and sceptical about my ability to perform my new role. Fay was welcoming, open and friendly, I immediately felt at ease. I had never heard of coaching before and Fay spent time explaining the concept and subtly contracted with me to set my expectations. I felt comfortable and safe and I was able to open up to Fay about my fears, she challenged me so sensitively that I was unaware that it was challenge and I was really able to objectively look at myself and my performance. Fay helped me work through my feelings and issues and we pragmatically planned actions for me to take so I could grow in confidence. Without Fay’s coaching I would have drowned in my first week of work and would probably have not been where I am today. Fay inspired me to train as a coach and I am now a level 7 CMI qualified coach. I cannot thank you enough Fay for this support and inspiration. I would recommend Fay to anyone thinking about coaching for themselves as individuals, or for their teams. Fay’s methods and techniques are so subtle but empowering, you really do discover the best version of yourself and you are able to find your own solutions.<br />

<p>Recently, on hitting a brick wall and not knowing how I was going to move forward, I accessed fay as my coach. I knew I needed someone who would be strong, assertive, challenging yet thoughtful and considerate. A contract was established immediately (so that you both know what to expect from the session) and each meeting starts with an exploration of my needs, sometimes I am unsure what they even are but Fay, using questioning techniques facilitates my thought processes in order to help me learn and identify my own solutions. It’s not always easy as emotions can suddenly spill out when i don’t expect it; Fay has remained professional, non-judgemental but most importantly kind, caring and compassionate throughout. I have full confidence in her confidentiality and sensitivity. Fay has a very calm demeanour and is easy to talk and relate with which makes these moments easier. Coaching with Fay has improved my motivation, confidence, increased my emotional intelligence and empowered me to be the best I can.</p>
