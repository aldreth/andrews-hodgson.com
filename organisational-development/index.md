    "Fay's ability to recognise behaviours, attitudes and encourage employees to manage themselves with
    a set of tools and responses made me truly believe in the power of organisational development."

<p>Organisational development (OD) is the practice of systematically applying behavioural science practices and principles to increase organisational effectiveness and well-being.  What is key to OD is that we attend to both human as well as organisational need.  In this time of immense change, the practice of OD can help clients through the change process, creating safe spaces for people to explore, learn, grow, make sense of their experience, develop relationships and take action in a way that feels inclusive.</p>
<p>Fay helps individuals and teams develop strategies, work through issues, learn about leadership and healthy functioning in organisational life, as well as plan and  make steps towards change.  It is about creating an environment which allows everyone to be their best.  She works with integrity, compassion and commitment.</p>
<p>Her close partnership with her clients ensures any work undertaken is bespoke for that particular team, individual or organisation.  She always starts with a process of scoping the need fully before working with her client to develop interventions. The process is wholly collaborative as well as iterative in nature.  She often co-creates interventions to ensure commitment to the process.  Fay helps organisations see what is under the surface, by attending to the psychological side of organisational life.  She is willing to work with the ‘real’; with what people actually feel, experience, need and desire and looks to help those elements align with the organisational direction.  She looks to help individuals and organisations find their strengths in order to build on those.</p>
