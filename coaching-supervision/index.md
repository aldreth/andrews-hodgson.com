<p><strong>What can you expect from coaching Supervision?</strong></p>
<p>Supervision is an integral part of the professional life of a coach.  It allows you a safe space to unpack your work and reflect; about what happened, what went well, how you could have coached differently and to gain ideas.  As a supervisor Fay can help you explore what’s getting in the way, what challenges you are facing as an outcome of your coaching work and what you need to develop your coaching practice.  It’s time for you, and it’s about helping you become the best practitioner you can be.</p>

<p>As with coaches, every supervisor has a different style; and it is vital for you to find the supervisor that suits you best.

She lets you discover the blocks and unearth your potential. She offers warmth and understanding as well as respectful challenge.
