<p><img class="wp-image-269  alignright" src="/assets/fay.png" alt="Fay Andrews-Hodgson" width="159" height="178" />An experienced Coach and OD professional of 10 years with a particular understanding of working in the NHS, Fay Andrews-Hodgson is a learning and development specialist with a focus on helping individuals, teams and organisations fulfil their potential.</p>
<p>Fay has coached people from many backgrounds; individuals often looking to live their life in a way that honours their personal and professional needs, as well as the multiple roles they play.  She believes coaching gives people the opportunity to take a step back and observe, reflect as well as take action, in order to live life in healthy and productive way.</p>
<p>Fay has a track record of OD practice, from working with struggling cultures to delivering large scale leadership programmes with strategic organisational relevance.  She has consistently delivered innovative and effective interventions that have a sustainable impact, improving organisational performance as well as the well-being of those involved.</p>
<p>After training in Occupational Psychology (MSc), Fay went on to train in Co-active Coaching with the Coaches Training Institute 10 years ago and she gained a CMI Level 7 in Leadership Mentoring and Coaching.  She has been coaching individuals and teams at a senior level in the organisational setting since then, training in coaching supervision in 2014.  She is deeply committed to working in partnership with her clients and bringing all her knowledge, skills and self to the process.</p>
